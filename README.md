# pypylondocker
Simple demonstration of running pypylon(https://github.com/basler/pypylon) samples within a docker container.

# Docker Pre-requisities

1. Install latest docker cli/docker daemon by following [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce). Follow **Install using the repository** and **Install Docker CE (follow first 2 steps)** sections there. Also, follow the manage docker as a non-root user section at [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) to run docker without sudo

2. Please follow the below steps only if the node/system on which the docker setup is tried out is running behind a HTTP proxy server. If that's not the case, this step can be skipped.

    * Configure proxy settings for docker client to connect to internet and for containers to access internet by following [https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/).

    * Configure proxy settings for docker daemon by following the steps at [https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy). Use the values for http proxy and https proxy as used in previous step.

    * The correct DNS servers need to be updated to the /etc/resolv.conf

        ```
        A. Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier

            For Ubuntu 16.04 and earlier, /etc/resolv.conf was dynamically generated by NetworkManager.

            Comment out the line dns=dnsmasq (with a #) in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

            Restart the NetworkManager to regenerate /etc/resolv.conf :
            sudo systemctl restart network-manager

            Verify on the host: cat /etc/resolv.conf

        B. Ubuntu 18.04 and later

            Ubuntu 18.04 changed to use systemd-resolved to generate /etc/resolv.conf. Now by default it uses a local DNS cache 127.0.0.53. That will not work inside a container, so Docker will default to Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS server, which may break for people behind a firewall.

            /etc/resolv.conf is actually a symlink (ls -l /etc/resolv.conf) which points to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf (127.0.0.53) by default in Ubuntu 18.04.

            Just change the symlink to point to /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf, which lists the real DNS servers:
            sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf

            Verify on the host: cat /etc/resolv.conf
        ```

3. Install `docker-compose` tool by following this [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)

# Steps to run

1. Building docker container:
    ```sh
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

2. Running docker container:
    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Run this below command to list running containers:
    ```sh
    $ docker ps
    ```

4. Once you obtain the name of the container from the previous step, run below command to exec into the container:
    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it <your_conatiner_name> bash
    ```

This should get you inside the docker container with pypylon samples present at (/pypylon/samples).
